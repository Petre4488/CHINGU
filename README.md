# CHINGU First Project - The Mars adventure

### Chingu Solo Project - Tier 1 - The Mars adventure

## About The Project
This is my first site i've done from scratch. I made my first site on some easy-to-use free website creator online about 1 and a half year ago. I tried to do 
it as good as i could, but the time wasn't my best friend.

## About Me
I'm a 16yo teenage from Romania. I m a volunteer at a project called CodeKids where we help kids learn Arduino, Scratch and AppInventor. I like programming and
sports and also I wanna become a fullstack developer. My main motivation is my familie because we don't rlly have much money so i wanna get a well-payed job
and help them and also sustain myself

## Why This Project And His Features
The main reason that made me choose that projects it's because i like space a lot. The site it's very simple and i'm glad i was able to do everything. I learned
to make every single thing on that website while doing it. I didn't really knew how to add a button or how to style it, but with tutorials, i did it :D. Somehow
I managed to delete my index page by mistake (idk how) and now i remade it. The first time when i did that index.htmt the site has a story, but unfortunately 
i don't have time right now. Don't worry, I'll make time for voyages :)
